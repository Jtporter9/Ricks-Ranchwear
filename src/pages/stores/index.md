    More than forty years ago the original store was opened just across the
    street from where we are today. Over the years the company grew and focused
    mainly on selling boots. In June of 2018, the name changed to Boot Factory
    Outlet to better reflect what we do. The location and the name may have
    changed, but the concept of great product selection and excellent customer
    service has never changed. It is the reason we have so many return customers
    as well as first time shoppers. Our community is one of many different
    cultures and professions. The new gas and oil industry boom has brought
    workers from all over the United States and even Europe to the store. They
    are always impressed with the sheer quantity and size selection of work
    boots, western boots, fashion, hiking, and motorcycle boots. 


    We carry national brands such as Rocky, Justin, Lucchese, Ariat, Wolverine, J.B. Dillon, Masterson, Santa Fe, Sterling River and more. You’ll find boots for the entire family with men’s sizes 6 to 16 including hard to find widths and ladies sizes 5-12 including wide widths and big selection of children’s boots.  


    Let our knowledgeable sales staff help you find the perfect fit. We look forward to making your shopping experience something you'll always remember.  Come on in and see how much fun it can be to Buy One Pair, Get Two Pair Free!
